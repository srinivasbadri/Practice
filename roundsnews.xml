<description><p>When you start building an observability stack, it’s natural to reach for logs first. They’re familiar, easy to generate, and often already part of a developer’s workflow. And sending logs to a centralized system feels like a quick win, too. Simply add a log shipper, and voila, your application is observable. </p></description>

<description><p><em>This meeting could’ve been an email.</em> </p> <p>It’s a phrase most of us have said (or at least thought) at some point in our careers. </p> <p>For me, that realization hit years ago while working for a government organization. I’d frequently sit through long, agendaless meetings that seemingly went nowhere. I wasn’t sure why I was there. And because I’m an engineer at heart, I started to wonder: what were these meetings actually costing the organization? Not just in abstract productivity hours, but in actual dollars and cents?</p></description>

<description><p>In observability, we’ve traditionally been taught to think in terms of <em>pillars</em>, namely logs, metrics, and traces (and more recently, profiles). But pillars are rigid and disconnected. They don’t reflect how modern systems actually work or how we troubleshoot in real time.</p></description>

<description><p>When you operate a restaurant, the last thing you want to do is shut your doors and turn away guests and staff because of some technology failure. And if you&rsquo;re the one providing that tech, it&rsquo;s your job to make sure that doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p></description>

<description><p>The benefits of observability are clear: deep visibility into system health, faster troubleshooting, and improved reliability (to name a few). But what’s equally clear is that, as organizations scale and evolve their observability strategies, they need a way to tap into these benefits without runaway costs.</p></description>

<description><p>When an incident lands in your lap, you&rsquo;ll often start with a lot of questions: <em>Why is latency so high? What&rsquo;s causing this outage? How much money are we losing at this very moment?</em></p></description>

<description><p>When it comes to observability, more data doesn’t always mean more clarity. In fact, as telemetry volumes grow, it only becomes more difficult to discern the signals from the noise and to keep overall costs in check.</p></description>
